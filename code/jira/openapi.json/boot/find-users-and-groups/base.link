  deed get
  note <Returns a list of users and groups matching a string. The string is used: * for users, to find a case-insensitive match with display name and e-mail address. Note that if a user has hidden their email address in their user profile, partial matches of the email address will not find the user. An exact match is required. * for groups, to find a case-sensitive match with group name. For example, if the string *tin* is used, records with the display name *Tina*, email address *sarah@tinplatetraining.com*, and the group *accounting* would be returned. Optionally, the search can be refined to: * the projects and issue types associated with a custom field, such as a user picker. The search can then be further refined to return only users and groups that have permission to view specific: * projects. * issue types. If multiple projects or issue types are specified, they must be a subset of those enabled for the custom field or no results are returned. For example, if a field is enabled for projects A, B, and C then the search could be limited to projects B and C. However, if the search is limited to projects B and D, nothing is returned. * not return Connect app users and groups. * return groups that have a case-insensitive match with the query. The primary use case for this resource is to populate a picker field suggestion list with users or groups. To this end, the returned object includes an `html` field for each list. This field highlights the matched query term in the item name with the HTML strong tag. Also, each list is wrapped in a response object that contains a header for use in a picker, specifically *Showing X of Y matching groups*. This operation can be accessed anonymously. **[Permissions](#permissions) required:** *Browse users and groups* [global permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg).>
