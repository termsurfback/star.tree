    note <The input image as base64-encoded bytes or an S3 object. If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing base64-encoded image bytes is not supported.

If you are using an AWS SDK to call Amazon Rekognition, you might not need to base64-encode image bytes passed using the `Bytes` field. For more information, see Images in the Amazon Rekognition developer guide.>

    note <An array of facial attributes you want to be returned. This can be the default list of attributes or all attributes. If you don't specify a value for `Attributes` or if you specify `["DEFAULT"]`, the API returns the following subset of facial attributes: `BoundingBox`, `Confidence`, `Pose`, `Quality`, and `Landmarks`. If you provide `["ALL"]`, all facial attributes are returned, but the operation takes longer to complete.

If you provide both, `["ALL", "DEFAULT"]`, the service uses a logical AND operator to determine which attributes to return (in this case, all attributes).>
