    note <The input image as base64-encoded bytes or an S3 object. If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing base64-encoded image bytes is not supported.

If you are using an AWS SDK to call Amazon Rekognition, you might not need to base64-encode image bytes passed using the `Bytes` field. For more information, see Images in the Amazon Rekognition developer guide.>
