form options, name <Options>
  note <Represents the options that are available to control the behavior of a [StartTaskExecution](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/API_StartTaskExecution.html) operation. Behavior includes preserving metadata such as user ID (UID), group ID (GID), and file permissions, and also overwriting files in the destination, data integrity verification, and so on.

A task has a set of default options associated with it. If you don't specify an option in [StartTaskExecution](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/API_StartTaskExecution.html), the default value is used. You can override the defaults options on each task execution by specifying an overriding `Options` value to [StartTaskExecution](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/API_StartTaskExecution.html).>
  take verify-mode, name <VerifyMode>
    like verify-mode
    void take
    note <A value that determines whether a data integrity verification should be performed at the end of a task execution after all data and metadata have been transferred. For more information, see [Configure task settings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/create-task.html).

Default value: POINT_IN_TIME_CONSISTENT.

ONLY_FILES_TRANSFERRED (recommended): Perform verification only on files that were transferred.

POINT_IN_TIME_CONSISTENT: Scan the entire source and entire destination at the end of the transfer to verify that source and destination are fully synchronized. This option isn't supported when transferring to S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage classes.

NONE: No additional verification is done at the end of the transfer, but all data transmissions are integrity-checked with checksum verification during the transfer.>
  take overwrite-mode, name <OverwriteMode>
    like overwrite-mode
    void take
    note <A value that determines whether files at the destination should be overwritten or preserved when copying files. If set to `NEVER` a destination file will not be replaced by a source file, even if the destination file differs from the source file. If you modify files in the destination and you sync the files, you can use this value to protect against overwriting those changes.

Some storage classes have specific behaviors that can affect your S3 storage cost. For detailed information, see [Considerations when working with Amazon S3 storage classes in DataSync](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/create-s3-location.html#using-storage-classes) in the _DataSync User Guide_.>
  take atime, name <Atime>
    like atime
    void take
    note <A file metadata value that shows the last time a file was accessed (that is, when the file was read or written to). If you set `Atime` to BEST_EFFORT, DataSync attempts to preserve the original `Atime` attribute on all source files (that is, the version before the PREPARING phase). However, `Atime`'s behavior is not fully standard across platforms, so DataSync can only do this on a best-effort basis.

Default value: BEST_EFFORT.

BEST_EFFORT: Attempt to preserve the per-file `Atime` value (recommended).

NONE: Ignore `Atime`.

If `Atime` is set to BEST_EFFORT, `Mtime` must be set to PRESERVE.

If `Atime` is set to NONE, `Mtime` must also be NONE.>
  take mtime, name <Mtime>

    void take
    note <A value that indicates the last time that a file was modified (that is, a file was written to) before the PREPARING phase. This option is required for cases when you need to run the same task more than one time.

Default value: PRESERVE.

PRESERVE: Preserve original `Mtime` (recommended)

NONE: Ignore `Mtime`.

If `Mtime` is set to PRESERVE, `Atime` must be set to BEST_EFFORT.

If `Mtime` is set to NONE, `Atime` must also be set to NONE.>

    void take
    note <A value that specifies whether files in the destination that don't exist in the source file system should be preserved. This option can affect your storage cost. If your task deletes objects, you might incur minimum storage duration charges for certain storage classes. For detailed information, see [Considerations when working with Amazon S3 storage classes in DataSync](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/create-s3-location.html#using-storage-classes) in the _DataSync User Guide_.

PRESERVE: Ignore such destination files (recommended).

REMOVE: Delete destination files that aren’t present in the source.>
  take preserve-devices, name <PreserveDevices>
    like preserve-devices
    void take
    note <A value that determines whether DataSync should preserve the metadata of block and character devices in the source file system, and re-create the files with that device name and metadata on the destination. DataSync does not copy the contents of such devices, only the name and metadata.

DataSync can't sync the actual contents of such devices, because they are nonterminal and don't return an end-of-file (EOF) marker.

Default value: NONE.

NONE: Ignore special devices (recommended).

PRESERVE: Preserve character and block device metadata. This option isn't currently supported for Amazon EFS.>
  take posix-permissions, name <PosixPermissions>

    like task-queueing
    void take
    note <A value that determines whether tasks should be queued before executing the tasks. If set to `ENABLED`, the tasks will be queued. The default is `ENABLED`.

If you use the same agent to run multiple tasks, you can enable the tasks to run in series. For more information, see [Queueing task executions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/run-task.html#queue-task-execution).>

    void take
    note <A value that determines whether DataSync transfers only the data and metadata that differ between the source and the destination location, or whether DataSync transfers all the content from the source, without comparing to the destination location.

CHANGED: DataSync copies only data or metadata that is new or different content from the source location to the destination location.

ALL: DataSync copies all source location content to the destination, without comparing to existing content on the destination.>
  take security-descriptor-copy-flags, name <SecurityDescriptorCopyFlags>
    like smb-security-descriptor-copy-flags
    void take
    note <A value that determines which components of the SMB security descriptor are copied from source to destination objects.

This value is only used for transfers between SMB and Amazon FSx for Windows File Server locations, or between two Amazon FSx for Windows File Server locations. For more information about how DataSync handles metadata, see [How DataSync Handles Metadata and Special Files](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/special-files.html).

Default value: OWNER_DACL.

**OWNER_DACL**: For each copied object, DataSync copies the following metadata:

- Object owner.

- NTFS discretionary access control lists (DACLs), which determine whether to grant access to an object.

When choosing this option, DataSync does NOT copy the NTFS system access control lists (SACLs), which are used by administrators to log attempts to access a secured object.

**OWNER_DACL_SACL**: For each copied object, DataSync copies the following metadata:

- Object owner.

- NTFS discretionary access control lists (DACLs), which determine whether to grant access to an object.

- NTFS system access control lists (SACLs), which are used by administrators to log attempts to access a secured object.

Copying SACLs requires granting additional permissions to the Windows user that DataSync uses to access your SMB location. For information about choosing a user that ensures sufficient permissions to files, folders, and metadata, see [user](create-smb-location.html#SMBuser).

**NONE**: None of the SMB security descriptor components are copied. Destination objects are owned by the user that was provided for accessing the destination location. DACLs and SACLs are set based on the destination server’s configuration.>
