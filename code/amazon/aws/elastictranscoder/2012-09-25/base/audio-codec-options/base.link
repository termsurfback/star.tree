    note <You can only choose an audio profile when you specify AAC for the value of Audio:Codec.

Specify the AAC profile for the output file. Elastic Transcoder supports the following profiles:

- `auto`: If you specify `auto`, Elastic Transcoder selects the profile based on the bit rate selected for the output file.

- `AAC-LC`: The most common AAC profile. Use for bit rates larger than 64 kbps.

- `HE-AAC`: Not supported on some older players and devices. Use for bit rates between 40 and 80 kbps.

- `HE-AACv2`: Not supported on some players and devices. Use for bit rates less than 48 kbps.

All outputs in a `Smooth` playlist must have the same value for `Profile`.

If you created any presets before AAC profiles were added, Elastic Transcoder automatically updated your presets to use AAC-LC. You can change the value as required.>

    void take
    note <You can only choose an audio bit depth when you specify `flac` or `pcm` for the value of Audio:Codec.

The bit depth of a sample is how many bits of information are included in the audio samples. The higher the bit depth, the better the audio, but the larger the file.

Valid values are `16` and `24`.

The most common bit depth is `24`.>
  take bit-order, name <BitOrder>
    like audio-bit-order
    void take
    note <You can only choose an audio bit order when you specify `pcm` for the value of Audio:Codec.

The order the bits of a PCM sample are stored in.

The supported value is `LittleEndian`.>
  take signed, name <Signed>
    like audio-signed
    void take
    note <You can only choose whether an audio sample is signed when you specify `pcm` for the value of Audio:Codec.

Whether audio samples are represented with negative and positive numbers (signed) or only positive numbers (unsigned).

The supported value is `Signed`.>
