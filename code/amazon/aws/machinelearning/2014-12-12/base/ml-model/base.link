The following is the current set of training parameters:

- `sgd.maxMLModelSizeInBytes` - The maximum allowed size of the model. Depending on the input data, the size of the model might affect its performance.

  The value is an integer that ranges from `100000` to `2147483648`. The default value is `33554432`.

- `sgd.maxPasses` - The number of times that the training process traverses the observations to build the `MLModel`. The value is an integer that ranges from `1` to `10000`. The default value is `10`.

- `sgd.shuffleType` - Whether Amazon ML shuffles the training data. Shuffling the data improves a model's ability to find the optimal solution for a variety of data types. The valid values are `auto` and `none`. The default value is `none`.

- `sgd.l1RegularizationAmount` - The coefficient regularization L1 norm, which controls overfitting the data by penalizing large coefficients. This parameter tends to drive coefficients to zero, resulting in sparse feature set. If you use this parameter, start by specifying a small value, such as `1.0E-08`.

  The value is a double that ranges from `0` to `MAX_DOUBLE`. The default is to not use L1 normalization. This parameter can't be used when `L2` is specified. Use this parameter sparingly.

- `sgd.l2RegularizationAmount` - The coefficient regularization L2 norm, which controls overfitting the data by penalizing large coefficients. This tends to drive coefficients to small, nonzero values. If you use this parameter, start by specifying a small value, such as `1.0E-08`.

  The value is a double that ranges from `0` to `MAX_DOUBLE`. The default is to not use L2 normalization. This parameter can't be used when `L1` is specified. Use this parameter sparingly.>
