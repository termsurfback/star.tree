If the `ResourceOwner` parameter is not specified, then the owner of the resources and the resource policy defaults to the account of the identity provided in `CallerArn`.

If you do not specify a `CallerArn`, it defaults to the ARN of the user that you specify in `PolicySourceArn`, if you specified a user. If you include both a `PolicySourceArn` (for example, `arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/David`) and a `CallerArn` (for example, `arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/Bob`), the result is that you simulate calling the API operations as Bob, as if Bob had David's policies.

You can specify only the ARN of an IAM user. You cannot specify the ARN of an assumed role, federated user, or a service principal.

`CallerArn` is required if you include a `ResourcePolicy` and the `PolicySourceArn` is not the ARN for an IAM user. This is required so that the resource-based policy's `Principal` element has a value to use in evaluating the policy.

If your simulation does not match one of the following scenarios, then you can omit this parameter. The following list shows each of the supported scenario values and the resources that you must define to run the simulation.

Each of the EC2 scenarios requires that you specify instance, image, and security group resources. If your scenario includes an EBS volume, then you must specify that volume as a resource. If the EC2 scenario includes VPC, then you must supply the network interface resource. If it includes an IP subnet, then you must specify the subnet resource. For more information on the EC2 scenario options, see [Supported platforms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-supported-platforms.html) in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide_.

- **EC2-Classic-InstanceStore** instance, image, security group
