  note <An instance type configuration for each instance type in an instance fleet, which determines the EC2 instances Amazon EMR attempts to provision to fulfill On-Demand and Spot target capacities. When you use an allocation strategy, you can include a maximum of 30 instance type configurations for a fleet. For more information about how to use an allocation strategy, see [Configure Instance Fleets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-instance-fleet.html). Without an allocation strategy, you may specify a maximum of five instance type configurations for a fleet.

The instance fleet configuration is available only in Amazon EMR versions 4.8.0 and later, excluding 5.0.x versions.>
