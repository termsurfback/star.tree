If you don't specify a value for `IPAddress`, Route 53 sends a DNS request to resolve the domain name that you specify in `FullyQualifiedDomainName` at the interval that you specify in `RequestInterval`. Using an IP address returned by DNS, Route 53 then checks the health of the endpoint.

Use one of the following formats for the value of `IPAddress`:

- **IPv4 address**: four values between 0 and 255, separated by periods (.), for example, `192.0.2.44`.

- **IPv6 address**: eight groups of four hexadecimal values, separated by colons (:), for example, `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345`. You can also shorten IPv6 addresses as described in RFC 5952, for example, `2001:db8:85a3::abcd:1:2345`.

If the endpoint is an EC2 instance, we recommend that you create an Elastic IP address, associate it with your EC2 instance, and specify the Elastic IP address for `IPAddress`. This ensures that the IP address of your instance will never change.

For more information, see [FullyQualifiedDomainName](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateHealthCheck.html#Route53-UpdateHealthCheck-request-FullyQualifiedDomainName).

Constraints: Route 53 can't check the health of endpoints for which the IP address is in local, private, non-routable, or multicast ranges. For more information about IP addresses for which you can't create health checks, see the following documents:

- [RFC 5735, Special Use IPv4 Addresses](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5735)

        note <The type of health check that you want to create, which indicates how Amazon Route 53 determines whether an endpoint is healthy.

You can't change the value of `Type` after you create a health check.

You can create the following types of health checks:

- **HTTP**: Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route 53 submits an HTTP request and waits for an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less than 400.

- **HTTPS**: Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route 53 submits an HTTPS request and waits for an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less than 400.

  If you specify `HTTPS` for the value of `Type`, the endpoint must support TLS v1.0 or later.

- **HTTP_STR_MATCH**: Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route 53 submits an HTTP request and searches the first 5,120 bytes of the response body for the string that you specify in `SearchString`.

- **HTTPS_STR_MATCH**: Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route 53 submits an `HTTPS` request and searches the first 5,120 bytes of the response body for the string that you specify in `SearchString`.

- **TCP**: Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection.

- **CLOUDWATCH_METRIC**: The health check is associated with a CloudWatch alarm. If the state of the alarm is `OK`, the health check is considered healthy. If the state is `ALARM`, the health check is considered unhealthy. If CloudWatch doesn't have sufficient data to determine whether the state is `OK` or `ALARM`, the health check status depends on the setting for `InsufficientDataHealthStatus`: `Healthy`, `Unhealthy`, or `LastKnownStatus`.

- **CALCULATED**: For health checks that monitor the status of other health checks, Route 53 adds up the number of health checks that Route 53 health checkers consider to be healthy and compares that number with the value of `HealthThreshold`.

- **RECOVERY_CONTROL**: The health check is assocated with a Route53 Application Recovery Controller routing control. If the routing control state is `ON`, the health check is considered healthy. If the state is `OFF`, the health check is considered unhealthy.

        void take
        note <Amazon Route 53 behavior depends on whether you specify a value for `IPAddress`.

**If you specify a value for** `IPAddress`:

Amazon Route 53 sends health check requests to the specified IPv4 or IPv6 address and passes the value of `FullyQualifiedDomainName` in the `Host` header for all health checks except TCP health checks. This is typically the fully qualified DNS name of the endpoint on which you want Route 53 to perform health checks.

When Route 53 checks the health of an endpoint, here is how it constructs the `Host` header:

- If you specify a value of `80` for `Port` and `HTTP` or `HTTP_STR_MATCH` for `Type`, Route 53 passes the value of `FullyQualifiedDomainName` to the endpoint in the Host header.

- If you specify a value of `443` for `Port` and `HTTPS` or `HTTPS_STR_MATCH` for `Type`, Route 53 passes the value of `FullyQualifiedDomainName` to the endpoint in the `Host` header.

- If you specify another value for `Port` and any value except `TCP` for `Type`, Route 53 passes `FullyQualifiedDomainName:Port` to the endpoint in the `Host` header.

If you don't specify a value for `FullyQualifiedDomainName`, Route 53 substitutes the value of `IPAddress` in the `Host` header in each of the preceding cases.

**If you don't specify a value for** `IPAddress`:

Route 53 sends a DNS request to the domain that you specify for `FullyQualifiedDomainName` at the interval that you specify for `RequestInterval`. Using an IPv4 address that DNS returns, Route 53 then checks the health of the endpoint.

If you don't specify a value for `IPAddress`, Route 53 uses only IPv4 to send health checks to the endpoint. If there's no resource record set with a type of A for the name that you specify for `FullyQualifiedDomainName`, the health check fails with a "DNS resolution failed" error.

If you want to check the health of weighted, latency, or failover resource record sets and you choose to specify the endpoint only by `FullyQualifiedDomainName`, we recommend that you create a separate health check for each endpoint. For example, create a health check for each HTTP server that is serving content for www.example.com. For the value of `FullyQualifiedDomainName`, specify the domain name of the server (such as us-east-2-www.example.com), not the name of the resource record sets (www.example.com).

In this configuration, if you create a health check for which the value of `FullyQualifiedDomainName` matches the name of the resource record sets and you then associate the health check with those resource record sets, health check results will be unpredictable.

In addition, if the value that you specify for `Type` is `HTTP`, `HTTPS`, `HTTP_STR_MATCH`, or `HTTPS_STR_MATCH`, Route 53 passes the value of `FullyQualifiedDomainName` in the `Host` header, as it does when you specify a value for `IPAddress`. If the value of `Type` is `TCP`, Route 53 doesn't pass a `Host` header.>

A health check can also have that status for other reasons. If SNI is enabled and you're still getting the error, check the SSL/TLS configuration on your endpoint and confirm that your certificate is valid.

The SSL/TLS certificate on your endpoint includes a domain name in the `Common Name` field and possibly several more in the `Subject Alternative Names` field.
