    note <The actions to take on a packet that matches one of the stateless rule definition's match attributes. You must specify a standard action and you can add custom actions.

Network Firewall only forwards a packet for stateful rule inspection if you specify `aws:forward_to_sfe` for a rule that the packet matches, or if the packet doesn't match any stateless rule and you specify `aws:forward_to_sfe` for the `StatelessDefaultActions` setting for the FirewallPolicy.

For every rule, you must specify exactly one of the following standard actions.

- **aws:pass** - Discontinues all inspection of the packet and permits it to go to its intended destination.

- **aws:drop** - Discontinues all inspection of the packet and blocks it from going to its intended destination.

- **aws:forward_to_sfe** - Discontinues stateless inspection of the packet and forwards it to the stateful rule engine for inspection.

Additionally, you can specify a custom action. To do this, you define a custom action by name and type, then provide the name you've assigned to the action in this `Actions` setting. For information about the options, see CustomAction.

To provide more than one action in this setting, separate the settings with a comma. For example, if you have a custom `PublishMetrics` action that you've named `MyMetricsAction`, then you could specify the standard action `aws:pass` and the custom action with `[“aws:pass”, “MyMetricsAction”]`.>
