        note <The raw email message. The message has to meet the following criteria:

- The message has to contain a header and a body, separated by one blank line.

- All of the required header fields must be present in the message.

- Each part of a multipart MIME message must be formatted properly.

- If you include attachments, they must be in a file format that Amazon Pinpoint supports.

- The entire message must be Base64 encoded.

- If any of the MIME parts in your message contain content that is outside of the 7-bit ASCII character range, you should encode that content to ensure that recipients' email clients render the message properly.

- The length of any single line of text in the message can't exceed 1,000 characters. This restriction is defined in [RFC 5321](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5321).>
