- `INOPERABLE`: A `DeleteStackInstances` operation has failed and left the stack in an unstable state. Stacks in this state are excluded from further `UpdateStackSet` operations. You might need to perform a `DeleteStackInstances` operation, with `RetainStacks` set to `true`, to delete the stack instance, and then delete the stack manually.

- `OUTDATED`: The stack isn't currently up to date with the stack set because:

  - The associated stack failed during a `CreateStackSet` or `UpdateStackSet` operation.

  - The stack was part of a `CreateStackSet` or `UpdateStackSet` operation that failed or was stopped before the stack was created or updated.

- `CURRENT`: The stack is currently up to date with the stack set.>
