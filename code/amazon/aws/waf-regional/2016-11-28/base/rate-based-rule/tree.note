  note <This is **AWS WAF Classic** documentation. For more information, see [AWS WAF Classic](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/classic-waf-chapter.html) in the developer guide.

**For the latest version of AWS WAF**, use the AWS WAFV2 API and see the [AWS WAF Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-chapter.html). With the latest version, AWS WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.

A `RateBasedRule` is identical to a regular Rule, with one addition: a `RateBasedRule` counts the number of requests that arrive from a specified IP address every five minutes. For example, based on recent requests that you've seen from an attacker, you might create a `RateBasedRule` that includes the following conditions:

- The requests come from 192.0.2.44.

- They contain the value `BadBot` in the `User-Agent` header.

In the rule, you also define the rate limit as 1,000.

Requests that meet both of these conditions and exceed 1,000 requests every five minutes trigger the rule's action (block or count), which is defined in the web ACL.>
  take rule-id, name <RuleId>
    like resource-id
    note <A unique identifier for a `RateBasedRule`. You use `RuleId` to get more information about a `RateBasedRule` (see GetRateBasedRule), update a `RateBasedRule` (see UpdateRateBasedRule), insert a `RateBasedRule` into a `WebACL` or delete one from a `WebACL` (see UpdateWebACL), or delete a `RateBasedRule` from AWS WAF (see DeleteRateBasedRule).>
  take name, name <Name>
    like resource-name
    void take
    note <A friendly name or description for a `RateBasedRule`. You can't change the name of a `RateBasedRule` after you create it.>
  take metric-name, name <MetricName>
    like metric-name
    void take
    note <A friendly name or description for the metrics for a `RateBasedRule`. The name can contain only alphanumeric characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9), with maximum length 128 and minimum length one. It can't contain whitespace or metric names reserved for AWS WAF, including "All" and "Default_Action." You can't change the name of the metric after you create the `RateBasedRule`.>
  take match-predicates, name <MatchPredicates>
    like predicates
    note <The `Predicates` object contains one `Predicate` element for each ByteMatchSet, IPSet, or SqlInjectionMatchSet object that you want to include in a `RateBasedRule`.>
  take rate-key, name <RateKey>
    like rate-key
    note <The field that AWS WAF uses to determine if requests are likely arriving from single source and thus subject to rate monitoring. The only valid value for `RateKey` is `IP`. `IP` indicates that requests arriving from the same IP address are subject to the `RateLimit` that is specified in the `RateBasedRule`.>
  take rate-limit, name <RateLimit>
    like rate-limit
    note <The maximum number of requests, which have an identical value in the field specified by the `RateKey`, allowed in a five-minute period. If the number of requests exceeds the `RateLimit` and the other predicates specified in the rule are also met, AWS WAF triggers the action that is specified for this rule.>
