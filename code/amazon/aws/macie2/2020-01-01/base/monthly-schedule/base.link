    note <The numeric day of the month when Amazon Macie runs the job. This value can be an integer from 1 through 31.

If this value exceeds the number of days in a certain month, Macie doesn't run the job that month. Macie runs the job only during months that have the specified day. For example, if this value is 31 and a month has only 30 days, Macie doesn't run the job that month. To run the job every month, specify a value that's less than 29.>
