You can optionally specify capacity weighting for each instance type. If no weight value is specified for an instance type, it is set to the default value "1".

    note <A flag that indicates whether instances in the game server group are protected from early termination. Unprotected instances that have active game servers running might be terminated during a scale-down event, causing players to be dropped from the game. Protected instances cannot be terminated while there are active game servers running except in the event of a forced game server group deletion (see ). An exception to this is with Spot Instances, which can be terminated by AWS regardless of protection status. This property is set to `NO_PROTECTION` by default.>

    note <Indicates how GameLift FleetIQ balances the use of Spot Instances and On-Demand Instances in the game server group. Method options include the following:

- `SPOT_ONLY` - Only Spot Instances are used in the game server group. If Spot Instances are unavailable or not viable for game hosting, the game server group provides no hosting capacity until Spot Instances can again be used. Until then, no new instances are started, and the existing nonviable Spot Instances are terminated (after current gameplay ends) and are not replaced.

- `SPOT_PREFERRED` - (default value) Spot Instances are used whenever available in the game server group. If Spot Instances are unavailable, the game server group continues to provide hosting capacity by falling back to On-Demand Instances. Existing nonviable Spot Instances are terminated (after current gameplay ends) and are replaced with new On-Demand Instances.

- `ON_DEMAND_ONLY` - Only On-Demand Instances are used in the game server group. No Spot Instances are used, even when available, while this balancing strategy is in force.>
