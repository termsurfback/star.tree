    note <An array of key:value pairs that you want to add to the container. You need to specify only the tags that you want to add or update. For example, suppose a container already has two tags (customer:CompanyA and priority:High). You want to change the priority tag and also add a third tag (type:Contract). For TagResource, you specify the following tags: priority:Medium, type:Contract. The result is that your container has three tags: customer:CompanyA, priority:Medium, and type:Contract.>
