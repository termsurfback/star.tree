form send-email-request, name <SendEmailRequest>
  note <Represents a request to send a single formatted email using Amazon SES. For more information, see the [Amazon SES Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/send-email-formatted.html).>
  take source, name <Source>
    like address
    note <The email address that is sending the email. This email address must be either individually verified with Amazon SES, or from a domain that has been verified with Amazon SES. For information about verifying identities, see the [Amazon SES Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/verify-addresses-and-domains.html).

If you are sending on behalf of another user and have been permitted to do so by a sending authorization policy, then you must also specify the `SourceArn` parameter. For more information about sending authorization, see the [Amazon SES Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/sending-authorization.html).

Amazon SES does not support the SMTPUTF8 extension, as described in [RFC6531](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6531). For this reason, the _local part_ of a source email address (the part of the email address that precedes the @ sign) may only contain [7-bit ASCII characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_address#Local-part). If the _domain part_ of an address (the part after the @ sign) contains non-ASCII characters, they must be encoded using Punycode, as described in [RFC3492](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3492.html). The sender name (also known as the _friendly name_) may contain non-ASCII characters. These characters must be encoded using MIME encoded-word syntax, as described in [RFC 2047](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2047). MIME encoded-word syntax uses the following form: `=?charset?encoding?encoded-text?=`.>

  take return-path, name <ReturnPath>
    like address
    void take
    note <The email address that bounces and complaints will be forwarded to when feedback forwarding is enabled. If the message cannot be delivered to the recipient, then an error message will be returned from the recipient's ISP; this message will then be forwarded to the email address specified by the `ReturnPath` parameter. The `ReturnPath` parameter is never overwritten. This email address must be either individually verified with Amazon SES, or from a domain that has been verified with Amazon SES.>
  take source-arn, name <SourceArn>
    like amazon-resource-name
    void take
    note <This parameter is used only for sending authorization. It is the ARN of the identity that is associated with the sending authorization policy that permits you to send for the email address specified in the `Source` parameter.

For example, if the owner of `example.com` (which has ARN `arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com`) attaches a policy to it that authorizes you to send from `user@example.com`, then you would specify the `SourceArn` to be `arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com`, and the `Source` to be `user@example.com`.
