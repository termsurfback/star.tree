The supported child policies are:

- `TERMINATE` - The child executions are terminated.

- `REQUEST_CANCEL` - A request to cancel is attempted for each child execution by recording a `WorkflowExecutionCancelRequested` event in its history. It is up to the decider to take appropriate actions when it receives an execution history with this event.

- `ABANDON` - No action is taken. The child executions continue to run.>
