    void take
  take message-deduplication-id
    like native-string
    note <This parameter applies only to FIFO (first-in-first-out) queues.

The token used for deduplication of sent messages. If a message with a particular `MessageDeduplicationId` is sent successfully, any messages sent with the same `MessageDeduplicationId` are accepted successfully but aren't delivered during the 5-minute deduplication interval. For more information, see [Exactly-once processing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/FIFO-queues-exactly-once-processing.html) in the _Amazon SQS Developer Guide_.

- Every message must have a unique `MessageDeduplicationId`,

  - You may provide a `MessageDeduplicationId` explicitly.

  - If you aren't able to provide a `MessageDeduplicationId` and you enable `ContentBasedDeduplication` for your queue, Amazon SQS uses a SHA-256 hash to generate the `MessageDeduplicationId` using the body of the message (but not the attributes of the message).

  - If you don't provide a `MessageDeduplicationId` and the queue doesn't have `ContentBasedDeduplication` set, the action fails with an error.

  - If the queue has `ContentBasedDeduplication` set, your `MessageDeduplicationId` overrides the generated one.

- When `ContentBasedDeduplication` is in effect, messages with identical content sent within the deduplication interval are treated as duplicates and only one copy of the message is delivered.

- If you send one message with `ContentBasedDeduplication` enabled and then another message with a `MessageDeduplicationId` that is the same as the one generated for the first `MessageDeduplicationId`, the two messages are treated as duplicates and only one copy of the message is delivered.

The `MessageDeduplicationId` is available to the consumer of the message (this can be useful for troubleshooting delivery issues).

If a message is sent successfully but the acknowledgement is lost and the message is resent with the same `MessageDeduplicationId` after the deduplication interval, Amazon SQS can't detect duplicate messages.

Amazon SQS continues to keep track of the message deduplication ID even after the message is received and deleted.

The maximum length of `MessageDeduplicationId` is 128 characters. `MessageDeduplicationId` can contain alphanumeric characters (`a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9`) and punctuation (``!"#$%&'()*+,-./:;&lt;=&gt;?@[\]^_`{|}~``).

For best practices of using `MessageDeduplicationId`, see [Using the MessageDeduplicationId Property](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/using-messagededuplicationid-property.html) in the _Amazon SQS Developer Guide_.>
    void take
  take message-group-id
    like native-string
    note <This parameter applies only to FIFO (first-in-first-out) queues.

The tag that specifies that a message belongs to a specific message group. Messages that belong to the same message group are processed in a FIFO manner (however, messages in different message groups might be processed out of order). To interleave multiple ordered streams within a single queue, use `MessageGroupId` values (for example, session data for multiple users). In this scenario, multiple consumers can process the queue, but the session data of each user is processed in a FIFO fashion.

- You must associate a non-empty `MessageGroupId` with a message. If you don't provide a `MessageGroupId`, the action fails.

- `ReceiveMessage` might return messages with multiple `MessageGroupId` values. For each `MessageGroupId`, the messages are sorted by time sent. The caller can't specify a `MessageGroupId`.

The length of `MessageGroupId` is 128 characters. Valid values: alphanumeric characters and punctuation ``(!"#$%&'()*+,-./:;&lt;=&gt;?@[\]^_`{|}~)``.

For best practices of using `MessageGroupId`, see [Using the MessageGroupId Property](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/using-messagegroupid-property.html) in the _Amazon SQS Developer Guide_.

`MessageGroupId` is required for FIFO queues. You can't use it for Standard queues.>
