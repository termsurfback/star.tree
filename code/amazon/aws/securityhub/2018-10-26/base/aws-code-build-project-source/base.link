    note <Information about the location of the source code to be built.

Valid values include:

- For source code settings that are specified in the source action of a pipeline in CodePipeline, location should not be specified. If it is specified, CodePipeline ignores it. This is because CodePipeline uses the settings in a pipeline's source action instead of this value.

- For source code in an CodeCommit repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source code and the build spec file (for example, `https://git-codecommit.region-ID.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/repo-name` ).

- For source code in an S3 input bucket, one of the following.

  - The path to the ZIP file that contains the source code (for example, `bucket-name/path/to/object-name.zip`).

  - The path to the folder that contains the source code (for example, `bucket-name/path/to/source-code/folder/`).

- For source code in a GitHub repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source and the build spec file.

- For source code in a Bitbucket repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source and the build spec file.>
