  note <This is **AWS WAF Classic** documentation. For more information, see [AWS WAF Classic](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/classic-waf-chapter.html) in the developer guide.

**For the latest version of AWS WAF**, use the AWS WAFV2 API and see the [AWS WAF Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-chapter.html). With the latest version, AWS WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.

Specifies the ByteMatchSet, IPSet, SqlInjectionMatchSet, XssMatchSet, RegexMatchSet, GeoMatchSet, and SizeConstraintSet objects that you want to add to a `Rule` and, for each object, indicates whether you want to negate the settings, for example, requests that do NOT originate from the IP address 192.0.2.44.>
  take negated, name <Negated>
    like negated
    note <Set `Negated` to `False` if you want AWS WAF to allow, block, or count requests based on the settings in the specified ByteMatchSet, IPSet, SqlInjectionMatchSet, XssMatchSet, RegexMatchSet, GeoMatchSet, or SizeConstraintSet. For example, if an `IPSet` includes the IP address `192.0.2.44`, AWS WAF will allow or block requests based on that IP address.

Set `Negated` to `True` if you want AWS WAF to allow or block a request based on the negation of the settings in the ByteMatchSet, IPSet, SqlInjectionMatchSet, XssMatchSet, RegexMatchSet, GeoMatchSet, or SizeConstraintSet. For example, if an `IPSet` includes the IP address `192.0.2.44`, AWS WAF will allow, block, or count requests based on all IP addresses _except_ `192.0.2.44`.>
  take type, name <Type>

    note <The type of predicate in a `Rule`, such as `ByteMatch` or `IPSet`.>
  take data-id, name <DataId>
    like resource-id
    note <A unique identifier for a predicate in a `Rule`, such as `ByteMatchSetId` or `IPSetId`. The ID is returned by the corresponding `Create` or `List` command.>
