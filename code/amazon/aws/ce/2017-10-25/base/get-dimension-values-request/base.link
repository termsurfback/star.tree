    note <The context for the call to `GetDimensionValues`. This can be `RESERVATIONS` or `COST_AND_USAGE`. The default value is `COST_AND_USAGE`. If the context is set to `RESERVATIONS`, the resulting dimension values can be used in the `GetReservationUtilization` operation. If the context is set to `COST_AND_USAGE`, the resulting dimension values can be used in the `GetCostAndUsage` operation.

If you set the context to `COST_AND_USAGE`, you can use the following dimensions for searching:

- AZ - The Availability Zone. An example is `us-east-1a`.

- DATABASE_ENGINE - The Amazon Relational Database Service database. Examples are Aurora or MySQL.

- INSTANCE_TYPE - The type of Amazon EC2 instance. An example is `m4.xlarge`.

- LEGAL_ENTITY_NAME - The name of the organization that sells you Amazon Web Services services, such as Amazon Web Services.

- SERVICE - The Amazon Web Services service such as Amazon DynamoDB.

- USAGE_TYPE - The type of usage. An example is DataTransfer-In-Bytes. The response for the `GetDimensionValues` operation includes a unit attribute. Examples include GB and Hrs.

- USAGE_TYPE_GROUP - The grouping of common usage types. An example is Amazon EC2: CloudWatch - Alarms. The response for this operation includes a unit attribute.

- REGION - The Amazon Web Services Region.

- RECORD_TYPE - The different types of charges such as RI fees, usage costs, tax refunds, and credits.

- RESOURCE_ID - The unique identifier of the resource. ResourceId is an opt-in feature only available for last 14 days for EC2-Compute Service.

If you set the context to `RESERVATIONS`, you can use the following dimensions for searching:

- AZ - The Availability Zone. An example is `us-east-1a`.
