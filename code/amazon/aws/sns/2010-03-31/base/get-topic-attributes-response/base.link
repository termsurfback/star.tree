    note <A map of the topic's attributes. Attributes in this map include the following:

- `DeliveryPolicy` - The JSON serialization of the topic's delivery policy.

- `DisplayName` - The human-readable name used in the `From` field for notifications to `email` and `email-json` endpoints.

- `Owner` - The account ID of the topic's owner.

- `Policy` - The JSON serialization of the topic's access control policy.

- `SubscriptionsConfirmed` - The number of confirmed subscriptions for the topic.

- `SubscriptionsDeleted` - The number of deleted subscriptions for the topic.

- `SubscriptionsPending` - The number of subscriptions pending confirmation for the topic.

- `TopicArn` - The topic's ARN.

- `EffectiveDeliveryPolicy` - The JSON serialization of the effective delivery policy, taking system defaults into account.

The following attribute applies only to [server-side-encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-server-side-encryption.html):

- `KmsMasterKeyId` - The ID of an Amazon Web Services managed customer master key (CMK) for Amazon SNS or a custom CMK. For more information, see [Key Terms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-server-side-encryption.html#sse-key-terms). For more examples, see [KeyId](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeKey.html#API_DescribeKey_RequestParameters) in the _Key Management Service API Reference_.

The following attributes apply only to [FIFO topics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-fifo-topics.html):

- `FifoTopic` - When this is set to `true`, a FIFO topic is created.

- `ContentBasedDeduplication` - Enables content-based deduplication for FIFO topics.

  - By default, `ContentBasedDeduplication` is set to `false`. If you create a FIFO topic and this attribute is `false`, you must specify a value for the `MessageDeduplicationId` parameter for the [Publish](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/api/API_Publish.html) action.

  - When you set `ContentBasedDeduplication` to `true`, Amazon SNS uses a SHA-256 hash to generate the `MessageDeduplicationId` using the body of the message (but not the attributes of the message).

    (Optional) To override the generated value, you can specify a value for the `MessageDeduplicationId` parameter for the `Publish` action.>
