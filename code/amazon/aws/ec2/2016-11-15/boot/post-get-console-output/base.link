  note <Gets the console output for the specified instance. For Linux instances, the instance console output displays the exact console output that would normally be displayed on a physical monitor attached to a computer. For Windows instances, the instance console output includes the last three system event log errors.

By default, the console output returns buffered information that was posted shortly after an instance transition state (start, stop, reboot, or terminate). This information is available for at least one hour after the most recent post. Only the most recent 64 KB of console output is available.

You can optionally retrieve the latest serial console output at any time during the instance lifecycle. This option is supported on instance types that use the Nitro hypervisor.

For more information, see [Instance console output](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-console.html#instance-console-console-output) in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide_.>
