- `addresses.private-ip-address` - The private IPv4 addresses associated with the network interface.

- `addresses.primary` - Whether the private IPv4 address is the primary IP address associated with the network interface.

- `addresses.association.public-ip` - The association ID returned when the network interface was associated with the Elastic IP address (IPv4).

- `addresses.association.owner-id` - The owner ID of the addresses associated with the network interface.

- `association.association-id` - The association ID returned when the network interface was associated with an IPv4 address.

- `association.allocation-id` - The allocation ID returned when you allocated the Elastic IP address (IPv4) for your network interface.

- `association.ip-owner-id` - The owner of the Elastic IP address (IPv4) associated with the network interface.

- `association.public-ip` - The address of the Elastic IP address (IPv4) bound to the network interface.

- `association.public-dns-name` - The public DNS name for the network interface (IPv4).

- `attachment.attachment-id` - The ID of the interface attachment.

- `attachment.attach-time` - The time that the network interface was attached to an instance.

- `attachment.delete-on-termination` - Indicates whether the attachment is deleted when an instance is terminated.

- `attachment.device-index` - The device index to which the network interface is attached.

- `attachment.instance-id` - The ID of the instance to which the network interface is attached.

- `attachment.instance-owner-id` - The owner ID of the instance to which the network interface is attached.

- `attachment.status` - The status of the attachment (`attaching` | `attached` | `detaching` | `detached`).

- `availability-zone` - The Availability Zone of the network interface.

- `description` - The description of the network interface.

- `group-id` - The ID of a security group associated with the network interface.

- `group-name` - The name of a security group associated with the network interface.

- `ipv6-addresses.ipv6-address` - An IPv6 address associated with the network interface.

- `mac-address` - The MAC address of the network interface.

- `network-interface-id` - The ID of the network interface.

- `owner-id` - The Amazon Web Services account ID of the network interface owner.

- `private-ip-address` - The private IPv4 address or addresses of the network interface.

- `private-dns-name` - The private DNS name of the network interface (IPv4).

- `requester-id` - The alias or Amazon Web Services account ID of the principal or service that created the network interface.

- `requester-managed` - Indicates whether the network interface is being managed by an Amazon Web Service (for example, Amazon Web Services Management Console, Auto Scaling, and so on).

- `source-dest-check` - Indicates whether the network interface performs source/destination checking. A value of `true` means checking is enabled, and `false` means checking is disabled. The value must be `false` for the network interface to perform network address translation (NAT) in your VPC.

- `status` - The status of the network interface. If the network interface is not attached to an instance, the status is `available`; if a network interface is attached to an instance the status is `in-use`.

- `subnet-id` - The ID of the subnet for the network interface.

- `tag`:&lt;key&gt; - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource. Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as the filter value. For example, to find all resources that have a tag with the key `Owner` and the value `TeamA`, specify `tag:Owner` for the filter name and `TeamA` for the filter value.

- `tag-key` - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this filter to find all resources assigned a tag with a specific key, regardless of the tag value.

- `vpc-id` - The ID of the VPC for the network interface.>
