- `PASSWORD_VERIFIER`: `PASSWORD_CLAIM_SIGNATURE`, `PASSWORD_CLAIM_SECRET_BLOCK`, `TIMESTAMP`, `USERNAME`, `SECRET_HASH` (if app client is configured with client secret).

- `ADMIN_NO_SRP_AUTH`: `PASSWORD`, `USERNAME`, `SECRET_HASH` (if app client is configured with client secret).

- `NEW_PASSWORD_REQUIRED`: `NEW_PASSWORD`, any other required attributes, `USERNAME`, `SECRET_HASH` (if app client is configured with client secret).

- `MFA_SETUP` requires `USERNAME`, plus you need to use the session value returned by `VerifySoftwareToken` in the `Session` parameter.

The value of the `USERNAME` attribute must be the user's actual username, not an alias (such as email address or phone number). To make this easier, the `AdminInitiateAuth` response includes the actual username value in the `USERNAMEUSER_ID_FOR_SRP` attribute, even if you specified an alias in your call to `AdminInitiateAuth`.>

    void take
    note <A map of custom key-value pairs that you can provide as input for any custom workflows that this action triggers.

You create custom workflows by assigning Lambda functions to user pool triggers. When you use the AdminRespondToAuthChallenge API action, Amazon Cognito invokes any functions that are assigned to the following triggers: _pre sign-up_, _custom message_, _post authentication_, _user migration_, _pre token generation_, _define auth challenge_, _create auth challenge_, and _verify auth challenge response_. When Amazon Cognito invokes any of these functions, it passes a JSON payload, which the function receives as input. This payload contains a `clientMetadata` attribute, which provides the data that you assigned to the ClientMetadata parameter in your AdminRespondToAuthChallenge request. In your function code in Lambda, you can process the `clientMetadata` value to enhance your workflow for your specific needs.

For more information, see [Customizing User Pool Workflows with Lambda Triggers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-identity-pools-working-with-aws-lambda-triggers.html) in the _Amazon Cognito Developer Guide_.

Take the following limitations into consideration when you use the ClientMetadata parameter:

- Amazon Cognito does not store the ClientMetadata value. This data is available only to Lambda triggers that are assigned to a user pool to support custom workflows. If your user pool configuration does not include triggers, the ClientMetadata parameter serves no purpose.

- Amazon Cognito does not validate the ClientMetadata value.

- Amazon Cognito does not encrypt the the ClientMetadata value, so don't use it to provide sensitive information.>
