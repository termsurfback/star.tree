- If `ClusterExists` is set to `false` and `ClusterIdentifier` isn't specified, all snapshots associated with deleted clusters (orphaned snapshots) are returned.

- If `ClusterExists` is set to `false` and `ClusterIdentifier` is specified for a deleted cluster, snapshots associated with that cluster are returned.
