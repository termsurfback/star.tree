    note <Indicates deployment status for conformance pack in a member account. When master account calls `PutOrganizationConformancePack` action for the first time, conformance pack status is created in the member account. When master account calls `PutOrganizationConformancePack` action for the second time, conformance pack status is updated in the member account. Conformance pack status is deleted when the master account deletes `OrganizationConformancePack` and disables service access for `config-multiaccountsetup.amazonaws.com`.

Config sets the state of the conformance pack to:

- `CREATE_SUCCESSFUL` when conformance pack has been created in the member account.

- `CREATE_IN_PROGRESS` when conformance pack is being created in the member account.

- `CREATE_FAILED` when conformance pack creation has failed in the member account.

- `DELETE_FAILED` when conformance pack deletion has failed in the member account.

- `DELETE_IN_PROGRESS` when conformance pack is being deleted in the member account.

- `DELETE_SUCCESSFUL` when conformance pack has been deleted in the member account.

- `UPDATE_SUCCESSFUL` when conformance pack has been updated in the member account.

- `UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS` when conformance pack is being updated in the member account.

- `UPDATE_FAILED` when conformance pack deletion has failed in the member account.>
