If a `capacityProviderStrategy` is specified, the `launchType` parameter must be omitted. If no `capacityProviderStrategy` or `launchType` is specified, the `defaultCapacityProviderStrategy` for the cluster is used.

When you use cluster auto scaling, you must specify `capacityProviderStrategy` and not `launchType`.

A capacity provider strategy may contain a maximum of 6 capacity providers.>
  take cluster, name <cluster>

    void take
    note <The infrastructure on which to run your standalone task. For more information, see [Amazon ECS launch types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/launch_types.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide_.

The `FARGATE` launch type runs your tasks on Fargate On-Demand infrastructure.

Fargate Spot infrastructure is available for use but a capacity provider strategy must be used. For more information, see [Fargate capacity providers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/userguide/fargate-capacity-providers.html) in the _Amazon ECS User Guide for Fargate_.

The `EC2` launch type runs your tasks on Amazon EC2 instances registered to your cluster.

The `EXTERNAL` launch type runs your tasks on your on-premise server or virtual machine (VM) capacity registered to your cluster.

A task can use either a launch type or a capacity provider strategy. If a `launchType` is specified, the `capacityProviderStrategy` parameter must be omitted.

When you use cluster auto scaling, you must specify `capacityProviderStrategy` and not `launchType`.>

You can override the default command for a container (that is specified in the task definition or Docker image) with a `command` override. You can also override existing environment variables (that are specified in the task definition or Docker image) on a container or add new environment variables to it with an `environment` override.

A total of 8192 characters are allowed for overrides. This limit includes the JSON formatting characters of the override structure.>

  take reference-id, name <referenceId>

  take started-by, name <startedBy>
    like string
    void take
    note <An optional tag specified when a task is started. For example, if you automatically trigger a task to run a batch process job, you could apply a unique identifier for that job to your task with the `startedBy` parameter. You can then identify which tasks belong to that job by filtering the results of a ListTasks call with the `startedBy` value. Up to 36 letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, hyphens, and underscores are allowed.

If a task is started by an Amazon ECS service, then the `startedBy` parameter contains the deployment ID of the service that starts it.>
  take tags, name <tags>
    like tags
    void take
    note <The metadata that you apply to the task to help you categorize and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define.

The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

- Maximum number of tags per resource - 50

- For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can have only one value.

- Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8

- Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8

- If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and resources, remember that other services may have restrictions on allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - = . _ : / @.

- Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.

- Do not use `aws:`, `AWS:`, or any upper or lowercase combination of such as a prefix for either keys or values as it is reserved for Amazon Web Services use. You cannot edit or delete tag keys or values with this prefix. Tags with this prefix do not count against your tags per resource limit.>
  take task-definition, name <taskDefinition>
    like string
    note <The `family` and `revision` (`family:revision`) or full ARN of the task definition to run. If a `revision` is not specified, the latest `ACTIVE` revision is used.>
