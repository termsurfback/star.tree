form scaling-instruction, name <ScalingInstruction>
  note <Describes a scaling instruction for a scalable resource in a scaling plan. Each scaling instruction applies to one resource.

AWS Auto Scaling creates target tracking scaling policies based on the scaling instructions. Target tracking scaling policies adjust the capacity of your scalable resource as required to maintain resource utilization at the target value that you specified.

AWS Auto Scaling also configures predictive scaling for your Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups using a subset of parameters, including the load metric, the scaling metric, the target value for the scaling metric, the predictive scaling mode (forecast and scale or forecast only), and the desired behavior when the forecast capacity exceeds the maximum capacity of the resource. With predictive scaling, AWS Auto Scaling generates forecasts with traffic predictions for the two days ahead and schedules scaling actions that proactively add and remove resource capacity to match the forecast.

We recommend waiting a minimum of 24 hours after creating an Auto Scaling group to configure predictive scaling. At minimum, there must be 24 hours of historical data to generate a forecast. For more information, see [Best Practices for AWS Auto Scaling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/plans/userguide/gs-best-practices.html) in the _AWS Auto Scaling User Guide_.>

For example, if the forecast says to add capacity at 10:00 AM, and the buffer time is 5 minutes, then the run time of the corresponding scheduled scaling action will be 9:55 AM. The intention is to give resources time to be provisioned. For example, it can take a few minutes to launch an EC2 instance. The actual amount of time required depends on several factors, such as the size of the instance and whether there are startup scripts to complete.

The value must be less than the forecast interval duration of 3600 seconds (60 minutes). The default is 300 seconds.

- `SetMaxCapacityToForecastCapacity` - AWS Auto Scaling may scale resource capacity higher than the maximum capacity to equal but not exceed forecast capacity.

- `SetMaxCapacityAboveForecastCapacity` - AWS Auto Scaling may scale resource capacity higher than the maximum capacity by a specified buffer value. The intention is to give the target tracking scaling policy extra capacity if unexpected traffic occurs.
