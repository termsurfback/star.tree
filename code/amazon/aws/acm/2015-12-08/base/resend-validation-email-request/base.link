  take certificate-arn, name <CertificateArn>
    like arn
    note <String that contains the ARN of the requested certificate. The certificate ARN is generated and returned by the RequestCertificate action as soon as the request is made. By default, using this parameter causes email to be sent to all top-level domains you specified in the certificate request. The ARN must be of the form:

`arn:aws:acm:us-east-1:123456789012:certificate/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012`>
  take domain, name <Domain>
    like domain-name-string
    note <The fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the certificate that needs to be validated.>
  take validation-domain, name <ValidationDomain>
    like domain-name-string
    note <The base validation domain that will act as the suffix of the email addresses that are used to send the emails. This must be the same as the `Domain` value or a superdomain of the `Domain` value. For example, if you requested a certificate for `site.subdomain.example.com` and specify a **ValidationDomain** of `subdomain.example.com`, ACM sends email to the domain registrant, technical contact, and administrative contact in WHOIS and the following five addresses:

- admin@subdomain.example.com

- administrator@subdomain.example.com

- hostmaster@subdomain.example.com

- postmaster@subdomain.example.com

- webmaster@subdomain.example.com>
