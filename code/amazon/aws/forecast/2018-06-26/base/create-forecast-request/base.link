    note <The quantiles at which probabilistic forecasts are generated. **You can currently specify up to 5 quantiles per forecast**. Accepted values include `0.01 to 0.99` (increments of .01 only) and `mean`. The mean forecast is different from the median (0.50) when the distribution is not symmetric (for example, Beta and Negative Binomial). The default value is `["0.1", "0.5", "0.9"]`.>

    note <The optional metadata that you apply to the forecast to help you categorize and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define.

The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

- Maximum number of tags per resource - 50.

- For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can have only one value.

- Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8.

- Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8.

- If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and resources, remember that other services may have restrictions on allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - = . _ : / @.

- Tag keys and values are case sensitive.

- Do not use `aws:`, `AWS:`, or any upper or lowercase combination of such as a prefix for keys as it is reserved for AWS use. You cannot edit or delete tag keys with this prefix. Values can have this prefix. If a tag value has `aws` as its prefix but the key does not, then Forecast considers it to be a user tag and will count against the limit of 50 tags. Tags with only the key prefix of `aws` do not count against your tags per resource limit.>
