    note <A cron expression that describes details about the monitoring schedule.

Currently the only supported cron expressions are:

- If you want to set the job to start every hour, please use the following:

  `Hourly: cron(0 * ? * * *)`

- If you want to start the job daily:

  `cron(0 [00-23] ? * * *)`

For example, the following are valid cron expressions:

- Daily at noon UTC: `cron(0 12 ? * * *)`

- Daily at midnight UTC: `cron(0 0 ? * * *)`

To support running every 6, 12 hours, the following are also supported:

`cron(0 [00-23]/[01-24] ? * * *)`

For example, the following are valid cron expressions:

- Every 12 hours, starting at 5pm UTC: `cron(0 17/12 ? * * *)`

- Every two hours starting at midnight: `cron(0 0/2 ? * * *)`

- Even though the cron expression is set to start at 5PM UTC, note that there could be a delay of 0-20 minutes from the actual requested time to run the execution.

- We recommend that if you would like a daily schedule, you do not provide this parameter. Amazon SageMaker will pick a time for running every day.>
