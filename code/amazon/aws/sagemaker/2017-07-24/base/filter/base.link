  take form resource-property-name

form filter, name <Filter>
  note <A conditional statement for a search expression that includes a resource property, a Boolean operator, and a value. Resources that match the statement are returned in the results from the Search API.

If you specify a `Value`, but not an `Operator`, Amazon SageMaker uses the equals operator.

In search, there are several property types:

Metrics

To define a metric filter, enter a value using the form `"Metrics.&lt;name&gt;"`, where `&lt;name&gt;` is a metric name. For example, the following filter searches for training jobs with an `"accuracy"` metric greater than `"0.9"`:

`{`

`"Name": "Metrics.accuracy",`

`"Operator": "GreaterThan",`

`"Value": "0.9"`

`}`

HyperParameters

To define a hyperparameter filter, enter a value with the form `"HyperParameters.&lt;name&gt;"`. Decimal hyperparameter values are treated as a decimal in a comparison if the specified `Value` is also a decimal value. If the specified `Value` is an integer, the decimal hyperparameter values are treated as integers. For example, the following filter is satisfied by training jobs with a `"learning_rate"` hyperparameter that is less than `"0.5"`:

`{`

`"Name": "HyperParameters.learning_rate",`

`"Operator": "LessThan",`

`"Value": "0.5"`

`}`

Tags

To define a tag filter, enter a value with the form `Tags.&lt;key&gt;`.>
  take name, name <Name>
    like resource-property-name
    note <A resource property name. For example, `TrainingJobName`. For valid property names, see SearchRecord. You must specify a valid property for the resource.>
  take operator, name <Operator>
    like operator
    void take
    note <A Boolean binary operator that is used to evaluate the filter. The operator field contains one of the following values:

Equals

The value of `Name` equals `Value`.

NotEquals

The value of `Name` doesn't equal `Value`.

Exists

The `Name` property exists.

NotExists

The `Name` property does not exist.

GreaterThan

The value of `Name` is greater than `Value`. Not supported for text properties.

GreaterThanOrEqualTo

The value of `Name` is greater than or equal to `Value`. Not supported for text properties.

LessThan

The value of `Name` is less than `Value`. Not supported for text properties.

LessThanOrEqualTo

The value of `Name` is less than or equal to `Value`. Not supported for text properties.

In

The value of `Name` is one of the comma delimited strings in `Value`. Only supported for text properties.

Contains

The value of `Name` contains the string `Value`. Only supported for text properties.

A `SearchExpression` can include the `Contains` operator multiple times when the value of `Name` is one of the following:

- `Experiment.DisplayName`

- `Experiment.ExperimentName`

- `Experiment.Tags`

- `Trial.DisplayName`

- `Trial.TrialName`

- `Trial.Tags`

- `TrialComponent.DisplayName`

- `TrialComponent.TrialComponentName`

- `TrialComponent.Tags`

- `TrialComponent.InputArtifacts`

- `TrialComponent.OutputArtifacts`

A `SearchExpression` can include only one `Contains` operator for all other values of `Name`. In these cases, if you include multiple `Contains` operators in the `SearchExpression`, the result is the following error message: "`'CONTAINS' operator usage limit of 1 exceeded.`">
  take value, name <Value>
    like filter-value
    void take
    note <A value used with `Name` and `Operator` to determine which resources satisfy the filter's condition. For numerical properties, `Value` must be an integer or floating-point decimal. For timestamp properties, `Value` must be an ISO 8601 date-time string of the following format: `YYYY-mm-dd'T'HH:MM:SS`.>
