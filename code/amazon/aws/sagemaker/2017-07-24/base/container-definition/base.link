    note <This parameter is ignored for models that contain only a `PrimaryContainer`.

When a `ContainerDefinition` is part of an inference pipeline, the value of the parameter uniquely identifies the container for the purposes of logging and metrics. For information, see [Use Logs and Metrics to Monitor an Inference Pipeline](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/inference-pipeline-logs-metrics.html). If you don't specify a value for this parameter for a `ContainerDefinition` that is part of an inference pipeline, a unique name is automatically assigned based on the position of the `ContainerDefinition` in the pipeline. If you specify a value for the `ContainerHostName` for any `ContainerDefinition` that is part of an inference pipeline, you must specify a value for the `ContainerHostName` parameter of every `ContainerDefinition` in that pipeline.>

    note <The path where inference code is stored. This can be either in Amazon EC2 Container Registry or in a Docker registry that is accessible from the same VPC that you configure for your endpoint. If you are using your own custom algorithm instead of an algorithm provided by Amazon SageMaker, the inference code must meet Amazon SageMaker requirements. Amazon SageMaker supports both `registry/repository[:tag]` and `registry/repository[@digest]` image path formats.

    void take
    note <The S3 path where the model artifacts, which result from model training, are stored. This path must point to a single gzip compressed tar archive (.tar.gz suffix). The S3 path is required for Amazon SageMaker built-in algorithms, but not if you use your own algorithms. For more information on built-in algorithms, see [Common Parameters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sagemaker-algo-docker-registry-paths.html).

The model artifacts must be in an S3 bucket that is in the same region as the model or endpoint you are creating.

If you provide a value for this parameter, Amazon SageMaker uses Amazon Web Services Security Token Service to download model artifacts from the S3 path you provide. Amazon Web Services STS is activated in your IAM user account by default. If you previously deactivated Amazon Web Services STS for a region, you need to reactivate Amazon Web Services STS for that region. For more information, see [Activating and Deactivating Amazon Web Services STS in an Amazon Web Services Region](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_enable-regions.html) in the _Amazon Web Services Identity and Access Management User Guide_.

If you use a built-in algorithm to create a model, Amazon SageMaker requires that you provide a S3 path to the model artifacts in `ModelDataUrl`.>
