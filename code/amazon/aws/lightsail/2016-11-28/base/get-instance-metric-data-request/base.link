Valid instance metric names are listed below, along with the most useful `statistics` to include in your request, and the published `unit` value.

- **`BurstCapacityPercentage`** - The percentage of CPU performance available for your instance to burst above its baseline. Your instance continuously accrues and consumes burst capacity. Burst capacity stops accruing when your instance's `BurstCapacityPercentage` reaches 100%. For more information, see [Viewing instance burst capacity in Amazon Lightsail](https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en_us/articles/amazon-lightsail-viewing-instance-burst-capacity).

  `Statistics`: The most useful statistics are `Maximum` and `Average`.

  `Unit`: The published unit is `Percent`.

- **`BurstCapacityTime`** - The available amount of time for your instance to burst at 100% CPU utilization. Your instance continuously accrues and consumes burst capacity. Burst capacity time stops accruing when your instance's `BurstCapacityPercentage` metric reaches 100%.

  Burst capacity time is consumed at the full rate only when your instance operates at 100% CPU utilization. For example, if your instance operates at 50% CPU utilization in the burstable zone for a 5-minute period, then it consumes CPU burst capacity minutes at a 50% rate in that period. Your instance consumed 2 minutes and 30 seconds of CPU burst capacity minutes in the 5-minute period. For more information, see [Viewing instance burst capacity in Amazon Lightsail](https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en_us/articles/amazon-lightsail-viewing-instance-burst-capacity).

  `Statistics`: The most useful statistics are `Maximum` and `Average`.

  `Unit`: The published unit is `Seconds`.

- **`CPUUtilization`** - The percentage of allocated compute units that are currently in use on the instance. This metric identifies the processing power to run the applications on the instance. Tools in your operating system can show a lower percentage than Lightsail when the instance is not allocated a full processor core.

  `Statistics`: The most useful statistics are `Maximum` and `Average`.

  `Unit`: The published unit is `Percent`.

- **`NetworkIn`** - The number of bytes received on all network interfaces by the instance. This metric identifies the volume of incoming network traffic to the instance. The number reported is the number of bytes received during the period. Because this metric is reported in 5-minute intervals, divide the reported number by 300 to find Bytes/second.

  `Statistics`: The most useful statistic is `Sum`.

  `Unit`: The published unit is `Bytes`.

- **`NetworkOut`** - The number of bytes sent out on all network interfaces by the instance. This metric identifies the volume of outgoing network traffic from the instance. The number reported is the number of bytes sent during the period. Because this metric is reported in 5-minute intervals, divide the reported number by 300 to find Bytes/second.

  `Statistics`: The most useful statistic is `Sum`.

  `Unit`: The published unit is `Bytes`.

- **`StatusCheckFailed`** - Reports whether the instance passed or failed both the instance status check and the system status check. This metric can be either 0 (passed) or 1 (failed). This metric data is available in 1-minute (60 seconds) granularity.

  `Statistics`: The most useful statistic is `Sum`.

  `Unit`: The published unit is `Count`.

- **`StatusCheckFailed_Instance`** - Reports whether the instance passed or failed the instance status check. This metric can be either 0 (passed) or 1 (failed). This metric data is available in 1-minute (60 seconds) granularity.

  `Statistics`: The most useful statistic is `Sum`.

  `Unit`: The published unit is `Count`.

- **`StatusCheckFailed_System`** - Reports whether the instance passed or failed the system status check. This metric can be either 0 (passed) or 1 (failed). This metric data is available in 1-minute (60 seconds) granularity.

  `Statistics`: The most useful statistic is `Sum`.

  `Unit`: The published unit is `Count`.>

The following statistics are available:

- `Minimum` - The lowest value observed during the specified period. Use this value to determine low volumes of activity for your application.

- `Maximum` - The highest value observed during the specified period. Use this value to determine high volumes of activity for your application.

- `Sum` - All values submitted for the matching metric added together. You can use this statistic to determine the total volume of a metric.

- `Average` - The value of Sum / SampleCount during the specified period. By comparing this statistic with the Minimum and Maximum values, you can determine the full scope of a metric and how close the average use is to the Minimum and Maximum values. This comparison helps you to know when to increase or decrease your resources.

- `SampleCount` - The count, or number, of data points used for the statistical calculation.>
