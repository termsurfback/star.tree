    note <The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that specifies the destination of the audit logs.

The destination can be any Amazon CloudWatch Logs log group ARN or Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream ARN, with the following requirements:

- The destination ARN that you provide (either CloudWatch Logs log group or Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream) must be in the same Amazon Web Services partition, Amazon Web Services Region, and Amazon Web Services account as your Amazon FSx file system.

- The name of the Amazon CloudWatch Logs log group must begin with the `/aws/fsx` prefix. The name of the Amazon Kinesis Data Firehouse delivery stream must begin with the `aws-fsx` prefix.

- If you do not provide a destination in `AuditLogDestination`, Amazon FSx will create and use a log stream in the CloudWatch Logs `/aws/fsx/windows` log group.

- If `AuditLogDestination` is provided and the resource does not exist, the request will fail with a `BadRequest` error.

- If `FileAccessAuditLogLevel` and `FileShareAccessAuditLogLevel` are both set to `DISABLED`, you cannot specify a destination in `AuditLogDestination`.>
