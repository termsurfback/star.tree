  note <Certificate revocation information used by the [CreateCertificateAuthority](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm-pca/latest/APIReference/API_CreateCertificateAuthority.html) and [UpdateCertificateAuthority](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm-pca/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateCertificateAuthority.html) actions. Your private certificate authority (CA) can configure Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) support and/or maintain a certificate revocation list (CRL). OCSP returns validation information about certificates as requested by clients, and a CRL contains an updated list of certificates revoked by your CA. For more information, see [RevokeCertificate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm-pca/latest/APIReference/API_RevokeCertificate.html) and [Setting up a certificate revocation method](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm-pca/latest/userguide/revocation-setup.html) in the _AWS Certificate Manager Private Certificate Authority (PCA) User Guide_.>
