AWS_ALIAS_DNS_NAME

For an alias record that routes traffic to an Elastic Load Balancing load balancer, the DNS name that's associated with the load balancer.

AWS_EC2_INSTANCE_ID (HTTP namespaces only)

The Amazon EC2 instance ID for the instance. When the `AWS_EC2_INSTANCE_ID` attribute is specified, then the `AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4` attribute contains the primary private IPv4 address.

AWS_INIT_HEALTH_STATUS

If the service configuration includes `HealthCheckCustomConfig`, you can optionally use `AWS_INIT_HEALTH_STATUS` to specify the initial status of the custom health check, `HEALTHY` or `UNHEALTHY`. If you don't specify a value for `AWS_INIT_HEALTH_STATUS`, the initial status is `HEALTHY`.

AWS_INSTANCE_CNAME

For a `CNAME` record, the domain name that Route 53 returns in response to DNS queries (for example, `example.com`).

AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4

For an `A` record, the IPv4 address that Route 53 returns in response to DNS queries (for example, `192.0.2.44`).

AWS_INSTANCE_IPV6

For an `AAAA` record, the IPv6 address that Route 53 returns in response to DNS queries (for example, `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345`).

AWS_INSTANCE_PORT

For an `SRV` record, the value that Route 53 returns for the port. In addition, if the service includes `HealthCheckConfig`, the port on the endpoint that Route 53 sends requests to.>
