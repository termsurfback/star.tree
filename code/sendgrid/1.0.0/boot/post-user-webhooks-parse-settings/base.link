  note <**This endpoint allows you to create a new inbound parse setting.** Creating an Inbound Parse setting requires two pieces of information: a `url` and a `hostname`. The `hostname` must correspond to a domain authenticated by Twilio SendGrid on your account. If you need to complete domain authentication, you can use the [Twilio SendGrid App](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/sender_auth) or the "Authenticate a domain" endpoint. See "[How to Set Up Domain Authentication](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/account-and-settings/how-to-set-up-domain-authentication/)" for instructions. Any email received by the `hostname` will be parsed when you complete this setup. You must also add a Twilio SendGrid MX record to this domain's DNS records. See "[Setting up the Inbound Parse Webhook](https://sendgrid.com/docs/for-developers/parsing-email/setting-up-the-inbound-parse-webhook/)" for full instructions. The `url` represents a location where the parsed message data will be delivered. Twilio SendGrid will make an HTTP POST request to this `url` with the message data. The `url` must be publicly reachable, and your application must return a `200` status code to signal that the message data has been received.>
