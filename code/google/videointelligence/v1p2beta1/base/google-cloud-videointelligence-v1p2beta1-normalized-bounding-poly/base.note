  note <Normalized bounding polygon for text (that might not be aligned with axis). Contains list of the corner points in clockwise order starting from top-left corner. For example, for a rectangular bounding box: When the text is horizontal it might look like: 0----1 | | 3----2 When it's clockwise rotated 180 degrees around the top-left corner it becomes: 2----3 | | 1----0 and the vertex order will still be (0, 1, 2, 3). Note that values can be less than 0, or greater than 1 due to trignometric calculations for location of the box.>
