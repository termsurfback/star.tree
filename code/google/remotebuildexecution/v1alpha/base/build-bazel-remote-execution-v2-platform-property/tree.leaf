  note <A single property for the environment. The server is responsible for specifying the property `name`s that it accepts. If an unknown `name` is provided in the requirements for an Action, the server SHOULD reject the execution request. If permitted by the server, the same `name` may occur multiple times. The server is also responsible for specifying the interpretation of property `value`s. For instance, a property describing how much RAM must be available may be interpreted as allowing a worker with 16GB to fulfill a request for 8GB, while a property describing the OS environment on which the action must be performed may require an exact match with the worker's OS. The server MAY use the `value` of one or more properties to determine how it sets up the execution environment, such as by making specific system files available to the worker. Both names and values are typically case-sensitive. Note that the platform is implicitly part of the action digest, so even tiny changes in the names or values (like changing case) may result in different action cache entries.>
